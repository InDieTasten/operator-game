Scenarios
-----------------

A scenario is the smallest "loadable" object in operator game.

A scenario consists of a walkable world in which interactions can be made.

Scenarios describe a goal for the player, which can either be achieved or failed.

Scenes
------

Inside of a scenario, a player can move between different scenes.

1. Walkable
2. Static

Scenes can either be "walkable" with the player in top down view, or they can be static first person views of panels, machines and so on.
